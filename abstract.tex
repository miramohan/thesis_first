\centerline{\emph{\bf PART \RNum{1}- Interactive Offline Interface To Debug Simulation Failure }}
\vspace{5pt}
Processor execution log created during simulation, contains in depth details pertaining to processor execution.  In the event of a simulation failure, debugging necessitates tracing through the execution logs for failure diagnosis.  Due to comprehensive information contained in these log files, it becomes overwhelming to comprehend it quickly enough, as information is spread across. Moreover, manual tracing is error-prone and time consuming.
This project aims to implement a GUI \nomenclature{GUI}{Graphical User Interface} enabling effortless and faster debug even from remote locations. The interface gathers data from multiple sources related to execution flow and presents it correlated, as appropriate. The graphic interactive navigation windows attempt to reduce the user's time spent on tracing cause of failure.

\centerline{\emph{\bf PART \RNum{2}- Improved Dual Simulation Approach To Gatesim}}
\vspace{5pt}
Gatesim or gate level simulation verification focuses on verifying the post layout netlist of the design. Gatesim verification is an important milestone and confidence builder on silicon quality. Multiple gatesim methodologies are in use across the industry. In co-simulation methodology of gatesim verification, full chip behavioral RTL \nomenclature{RTL}{Register Transfer Level description of circuit} and gate netlist are simulated simultaneously in one simulation. Verification is achieved by driving corresponding RTL stimulus onto netlist and by comparing response every cycle.
The objective of this project is to improve the simulation turn-around times and reducing resource requirements involved in Gatesim verification without compromising on verification itself. A new methodology to Gatesim is proposed that promises faster closure on verification without compromising on existing advantages.

%This improved methodology attempts to overcome performance issues with current co-simulation methodology.
