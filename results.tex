\chapter{RESULTS}
\label{chap:results.tex}
A new gate simulation flow based on separate simulation of RTL and netlist was developed. Performance analysis was done with respect to co-sim methodology. A set of standard test cases were considered for the purpose. An exclusive machine was used for benchmarking and hence tests were run in sequence one after the other in both the methodologies. The machine features were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux 2.6.18-308.1.1.el5
\item Authentic AMD family F model 1 stepping 2
\item AMD FX(tm)-8150 Eight-Core Processor
\item MemTotal:     32925800 kB
\end{itemize}
