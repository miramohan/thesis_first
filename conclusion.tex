\chapter{CONCLUSION}
\label{chap:conclusion}
A new dual-sim or sim after sim flow for gatesim was developed and simulation performances was benchmaked on dedicated machine and compared against current co-simulation method. The simulation performance shows a consistent improvement of around 10 times over the current method. Use of FSDB as the source of test vectors keep the file size small and get rid of bulky time hogging test bench components, and thereby reducing rerun time. This 10 times improvement in simulation performance will help in reducing delay in tape out due to gatesim verification overheads. The method still require a one time RTL simulation run for generating FSDB file. The existing gatesim flow can be maintained as it is and only few changes need to be included in current flow for accommodating the new method. 
\paragraph{Potential for future work:}The performance of dual-sim method can be further increased by improving the VPI/PLI access methods.
