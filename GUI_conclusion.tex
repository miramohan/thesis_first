\chapter{CONCLUSION}
\label{chap:GUI_conclusion}

An interactive off-line graphical user interface was designed and developed. The interface is a web based html page having all the relevant information from processor execution log and asm test files. The execution graph  helps in analysis of various operations like branching, exception, read/write etc. This graph sort instruction execution information into corresponding thread making tracing rather easy. The register window provides comparison between registers and flag values at two different execution cycle which helps in tracking a wrong value written into register or flag. Instruction window and execution log window provide all the detailed information that could be obtained from list file and execution log file regarding the cycle selected from the graph. 

\paragraph{Potential for future work:} The interface tries to gather and represent data for easy debugging. There is scope for introducing more debug features like break points.
